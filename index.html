      <h2>Welcome to my project for COMP 476. We were tasked with installing an OS system and webserver application on to a Raspberry Pi.</h2> 
      <h3> Here's a little bit about me: My name is Niya Henderson and and I am a honors, senior computer science student from La Plata, Maryland. I have two brothers, one is older and the other is younger. I really enjoy cooking, traveling and playing volleyball. A fun fact about me is that I interned at Google two summers ago.</h3>
